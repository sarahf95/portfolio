          I am a recently graduated from the University of Washington with a
          bachelors in Informatics and a minor in entrepreneurship. During my
          time at the iSchool, I focused on human computer interaction and front
          end development. I am passionate about connecting people with
          technology and finding creative solutions to projects. My Informatics
          capstone AMPR showcases this clearly.

          In my free time I enjoy running, hiking, and enjoying Seattleâ€™s great
          food and beer with friends. I also enjoy traveling, music, and dogs.
